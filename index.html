  <h2>Where I started</h2>
  <div class="about-container">
    <p>
      My name is John Dragos and I am a student at 
      Ohio University.
      My journey started in a town named Niles, Ohio.
      I grew up, went to high school, and found what I 
      thought to be my passion, business. 
      I'm social,
      easy to get along with, and very persuasive, qualities 
      that made business feel like a natural path.
       I followed my
      family's footsteps, enrolling 
      at Ohio University, where I spent 
      two years studying Accounting, Information Systems, and Finance
      before I came to a realization:

    <div class="inline-break">This was not what I wanted to do.</div>
    <p>
    Business lacked the hands-on learning that I wanted,
    I needed to be fulfilled. The sleepless night before my 
    next semester in business started, I put together a plan;
    Electrical Engineering. A degree that has an average
    time to graduate of five years, I planned to do in
    just six semesters, or three years. I knew it was
    a daunting task ahead of me, and I was finally excited!
    Challenging classes, late night projects, and new 
    skills I had never dreamed of (like building my own
    website.)
    </p>
    <div class="small-inline-break"> </div>
    <p>
      I started in my introductory courses when my professor
      put an idea into my head, undergraduate research.
      I had never known that students could do things like
      that outside of internships, and my interest was piqued.
      It sounded like everything I wanted out of this major,
      hands-on work, cutting-edge ideas, and challenging,
      intellectual studies.
      Opportunity knocked and I answered, working on different
      research with professors in different fields. Researching,
      learning in classes, and working on personal passion 
      projects explored in this website! The real measure
      of success is not where you start, but how willing
      you are to grow, adapt, and chase what drives you with 
      everything you've got.
